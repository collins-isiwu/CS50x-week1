# CS50---week-1
## Introduction
After I understood how the technology world works and how important it is to document ones code on GitHub, I decided to add all the assignments (problem sets) I did while offering Harvard's CS50x course on my public repository.
For the first week, we were taught the basis of C. The chief lecturer for the course - Prof. David J. Malan said that the department decided to teach C first so as to teach the students the basis of programming. He said that most modern programming languages were built from C. To be honest, learning C as a first programming language was tough! But it made me who I'm today - tough. It made it easy to learn other programming languages like python and javascript. 
It is important to note that CS50 assignments are very tough. This is the more reason I said that it must be documented here. I spent way too much time to leave it undocumented in my public repository.
